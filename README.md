Coding for fun.

https://adventofcode.com/

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.\
People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far.\
Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.


[!] It is for fun, so not a part of sprint work - manage your time wisely\
[!] Use any language that you want to learn or polish\
[!] Ask people for code review to get some tips and advice\
[!] No rush, no competition, no prizes :)
